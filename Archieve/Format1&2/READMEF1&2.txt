F1&2
This is my iteration of F1&2, you can recycle or reuse the masterFormat function for formats 3 and 4

NOTE:
- Currently the output will be a vector of vectors
- Output when printing will be in this order: Location, Source statement (label, instruction, extra stuff i forgot the name of), and then object code

IMPORTANT REGARDING IMPLEMENTATION:
- I am assuming that if there is no label, that in the position in vector that is empty, it passes me ""

TODO:
- What is needed is something to call with the correct parameters
