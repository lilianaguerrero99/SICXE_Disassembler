printFiles is consider our MAIN file, and when you compile write: g++ printFiles.cpp

I changed the opcodeTable file so we don't need to include it when we compile and we don't need to create an object for it when we use it.
I fixed all the places where we were using it and the code should compile.
I also found the code I wrote for getBinaryValues to make our code look cleaner. This code is in openFiles.cpp

If you have any questions just text in the group chat. I'll try to work on format 3 again on friday and over the weekend,
  and Marie and I decided not to combine our formats.
